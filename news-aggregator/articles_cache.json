Half of Sudan\u2019s population are judged to be desperately short of food, with 11 million people internally displaced.</p><div id=\"sign-in-gate\"></div><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The initiative holds risks for the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, since it may require him to place pressure on some of the UK\u2019s Middle Eastern allies to make good on their promises no longer to arm the warring parties.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The UK along with Germany and France, which are co-hosting the conference, have not invited to London the two warring parties, the Sudanese Armed Forces or the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group that has attacked non-Arabic groups in Darfur.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The two sides are judged to be a long way from seeking peace and it is thought diplomatic energy is best placed on securing a consensus among rival external backers that a ceasefire must be demanded and impunity for war crimes will end.</p><figure class=\"dcr-1your1i\" data-spacefinder-role=\"richLink\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement\" id=\"f7c12db0-82db-447d-811f-ccfc120be68e\"><div class=\"dcr-1kyw41h\" data-component=\"rich-link\" data-link-name=\"rich-link-5 | 5\" data-name=\"placeholder\" data-print-layout=\"hide\"><div class=\"dcr-cd8h3r\" data-format-design=\"0\" data-format-display=\"0\" data-format-theme=\"5\"><div class=\"dcr-1lhuo3r\"></div><div class=\"dcr-ut4tvs\"><div class=\"dcr-1h5b6rb\"><div class=\"dcr-1dgt1gs\">\u2018No one recognised him, even as he said his name\u2019: last video of rescued man shows horror of Sudan torture camps</div></div><div class=\"dcr-eurq8n\"><div class=\"dcr-fkf7vq\">Read more</div></div></div></div></div></figure><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Sudan\u2019s foreign minister, Ali Youssef, has written to Lammy to protest against his exclusion. Youssef also criticised invitations to the conference for the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Chad and Kenya, which he termed \u201cstakeholders in the war\u201d.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Sudan\u2019s government has accused the UAE, a close UK ally, of complicity in genocide by covertly arming the RSF, headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, commonly known as Hemedti. The UAE has condemned as a publicity stunt the Sudanese government\u2019s decision to take on 10 April its claim of UAE complicity to the international court of justice, saying Abu Dhabi helped the RSF commit genocide against the Masalit tribe in West Darfur.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The Sudanese government, itself backed by another UK ally Saudi Arabia as well as Egypt, has also been accused of war crimes. Both the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF have formally been accused by the UN of using starvation as a weapon of war.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">A harsh spotlight is also very likely to fall in London on the impact of USAID cuts on the provision of humanitarian aid in Sudan as well as the withdrawal of funding from academic groups that have been monitoring war crimes and the build-up of famine.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">NGOs such as Human Rights Watch are also urging the ministerial conference to emphasise the importance of civilian protection, independent of a ceasefire.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">At an event previewing the conference, Kate Ferguson, the co-director of the NGO Protection Approaches, said: \u201cThe conference comes at a critical moment for civilians in Sudan as areas of control under various armed forces rapidly evolve and civilians face an increasing spectrum of varied attack.\u201d</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">She added: \u201cA new vehicle is needed to take forward civilian protection. This is a moment here to create something new that is desperately needed \u2013 whether that is a coalition of conscience or a contact group.\u201d</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Ferguson added that \u201ccitizens were facing an unimaginable triple threat of armed conflict, identity-based atrocity crimes and humanitarian catastrophe\u201d.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Shayna Lewis from Avaaz said: \u201cThe solution that can yield the greatest impact for civilian protection is the restoration of telecommunication networks. More than 25 million people are cut off from the internet and cannot send texts or make phone calls. This is the equivalent of half of England\u2019s population being cut off from the outside world and that explains why it is so difficult for the media to cover Sudan.\u201d</p></div></div><div class=\"dcr-fckw05\" data-print-layout=\"hide\">Explore more on these topics<div class=\"dcr-11qmbjk\"><ul class=\"dcr-1rrvs2w\"><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">Sudan</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">Middle East and north Africa</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">David Lammy</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">Africa</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">news</li></ul></div><div class=\"dcr-nu129i\">Share<div class=\"src-button-space\"></div><div class=\"dcr-zhx6xs\">Reuse this content</div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"dcr-bcwpw1\" data-gu-name=\"right-column\" style=\"--grid-area:right-column;\"><div class=\"dcr-tn16h9\"><div class=\"dcr-1e3xwa3\" data-container=\"most-viewed-right-container\"></div></div></div></div></div></article>", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b07f3930207bcd51128b2d1b00f451cfd1faa7b4/0_277_6996_4197/master/6996.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=25d307608b4f2016a25695f6ad69692d", "source_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss"}, {"title": "Israeli air strike destroys part of last fully functional hospital in Gaza City", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr7l123zy5o", "published": "Sun, 13 Apr 2025 18:28:55 GMT", "source": "BBC News", "content": "<article><div class=\"sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB\" data-component=\"headline-block\">Israeli air strike destroys part of last fully functional hospital in Gaza City<!-- --></div><div class=\"sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ\" data-component=\"byline-block\"><div class=\"sc-b42e7a8f-0 haItSe\" data-testid=\"byline-new\"><div class=\"sc-b42e7a8f-1 cjDa-dM\">45 minutes ago<div class=\"sc-b42e7a8f-3 cFXrjb\"><!--$!--><!--/$--></div></div><div class=\"sc-b42e7a8f-12 fcCDwR\" data-testid=\"byline-new-contributors\"><div class=\"sc-b42e7a8f-5 evAEAB\"><div>Rushdi Abualouf<div class=\"sc-b42e7a8f-8 bTSIhT\">Gaza correspondent<!-- --></div></div></div></div><div class=\"sc-b42e7a8f-4 ffcVEa\"><!--$!--><!--/$--></div></div></div><div class=\"sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG\" data-component=\"video-block\" data-testid=\"fabl-video-container\"><div class=\"sc-248dbe6b-0 jEQyFR\"><div class=\"sc-248dbe6b-1 iajJmE\" data-testid=\"\" style=\"visibility:hidden\"></div></div></div><div class=\"sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ\" data-component=\"caption-block\">Footage shows damage at Gaza City hospital site<!-- --></div><div class=\"sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ\" data-component=\"text-block\"><p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ\">An Israeli air strike has destroyed part of al Ahli Arab Hospital, the last fully functional hospital in Gaza City.<!-- --></p><p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ\">Witnesses said the strike destroyed the intensive care and surgery departments of the hospital.<!-- --></p><p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ\">Video posted online appeared to show huge flames and smoke rising after missiles hit a two-storey building.

The conference of 20 countries and organisations will inevitably shine a spotlight on the United Arab Emirates, past backers of the RSF, to issue an unambiguous statement of condemnation.</p><figure class=\"element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2\" data-alt=\"Locator graphic\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-testid=\"interactive-element-Locator%20graphic\" id=\"9fe77b49-ee72-457f-b283-521d3c12bae2\"><div class=\"dcr-ri3hap\" data-name=\"placeholder\"><div class=\"dcr-1h7eqaz\"></div></div>Locator graphic</figure><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The attacks on Um Kadadah, about 180km (112 miles) east of El Fasher, came one day after RSF fighters said they had taken the town from army forces. The victims appeared to be targeted because of their ethnicity.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Lammy tweeted: \u201cShocking reports are emerging from El Fasher, Darfur, where indiscriminate RSF attacks have killed civilians, including aid workers. This gives added urgency to Tuesday\u2019s Sudan conference in London with international partners. All sides must commit to protection of civilians.\u201d</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The UN\u2019s resident and humanitarian coordinator in Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, said she was \u201cappalled and gravely alarmed by reports emerging from Zamzam and Abu Shouk displacement camps as well as El Fasher town in North Darfur\u201d. The two camps protect as many as 700,000 civilians displaced by previous violence and famine.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The Yale School of Public Health\u2019s Humanitarian Research Lab said it had observed that \u201carson attacks have burned multiple structures and significant areas of the Zamzam camp in the centre, south and south-east portions of the camp\u201d.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The UN reported that the RSF had launched coordinated ground and air attacks on the camps and El Fasher from multiple directions on 11 April, triggering intense clashes and resulting in catastrophic consequences for civilians.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The UN said more than 100 people, including more than 20 children, were feared dead, including nine Relief International personnel. The Sudanese army said more than 70 people had been killed in El Fasher alone. The precise death toll was unverifiable due to deliberate internet shutdowns implemented by the RSF.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Last month the army recaptured the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, about 1,000km (600 miles) to the east.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Adam Regal, a spokesperson for the General Coordination for Refugees and Displaced in Darfur, said Zamzam and Abou Shouk remained under artillery shelling and an assault by RSF armed vehicles on Sunday.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Relief International said of the loss of its staff: \u201cWe understand this was a targeted attack on all health infrastructure in the region to prevent access to healthcare for internally displaced people. We are horrified that one of our clinics was also part of this attack \u2013 along with other health facilities in El Fasher.\u201d</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Both the Biden and Trump administrations in the US have said the RSF has committed genocide in Darfur, and that the army has attacked civilians. The Sudanese government last week took the UAE to the international court of justice, the UN\u2019s top court, claiming the UAE was complicit in genocide.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Kate Ferguson, a co-director of Protection Approaches, said: \u201cIt appears that the RSF is attacking Zamzam, Abu Shouk and El Fasher simultaneously for the first time, including a ground assault on Zamzam. This is a significant escalation in violence against civilians in the North Darfur region and requires immediate diplomatic response.\u201d</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">She said she feared such \u201ca coordinated military effort by the RSF would represent the beginning of the assault we have all so long feared \u2013 including further acts of genocide and crimes against humanity \u2013 and should trigger all emergency diplomatic and other responses.\u201d</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">She added: \u201cIn hosting the conference on Tuesday, Lammy holds the heavy responsibility of securing a collective response to the appalling atrocities committed yesterday and this weekend. It is a tough but rare opportunity to bring international commitment to protect civilians in Sudan from strong words to resolute action.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">\u201cThis means sincerely confronting those backing and enabling atrocity crimes, and establishing a serious senior coalition willing to advance at pace the political and technical solutions necessary to halt genocide, crimes against humanity, war and famine.\u201d</p></div></div><div class=\"dcr-fckw05\" data-print-layout=\"hide\">Explore more on these topics<div class=\"dcr-11qmbjk\"><ul class=\"dcr-1rrvs2w\"><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">Sudan</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">Africa</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">Middle East and north Africa</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">news</li></ul></div><div class=\"dcr-nu129i\">Share<div class=\"src-button-space\"></div><div class=\"dcr-zhx6xs\">Reuse this content</div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"dcr-bcwpw1\" data-gu-name=\"right-column\" style=\"--grid-area:right-column;\"><div class=\"dcr-tn16h9\"><div class=\"dcr-1e3xwa3\" data-container=\"most-viewed-right-container\"></div></div></div></div></div></article>", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afc79f3fb70721b30480f2dd780086ee375b05f1/0_20_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2e4fc485c7001cc4aed2e80a38c95d0a", "source_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss"}, {"title": "The Last of Us is back, and it&#x27;s The Apprentice final: What&#x27;s coming up this week", "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjlypezdmno", "published": "Sun, 13 Apr 2025 16:33:44 GMT", "source": "BBC News", "content": "<article><div class=\"sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB\" data-component=\"headline-block\">The Last of Us is back, and it's The Apprentice final: What's coming up this week<!-- --></div><div class=\"sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ\" data-component=\"byline-block\"><div class=\"sc-b42e7a8f-0 haItSe\" data-testid=\"byline-new\"><div class=\"sc-b42e7a8f-1 cjDa-dM\">3 hours ago<div class=\"sc-b42e7a8f-3 cFXrjb\"><!--$!--><!--/$--></div></div><div class=\"sc-b42e7a8f-12 fcCDwR\" data-testid=\"byline-new-contributors\"><div class=\"sc-b42e7a8f-5 evAEAB\"><div>Noor Nanji<div class=\"sc-b42e7a8f-8 bTSIhT\">Culture reporter<!-- -->\u2022@NoorNanji</div></div></div></div><div class=\"sc-b42e7a8f-4 ffcVEa\"><!--$!--><!--/$--></div></div></div><figure><div class=\"sc-18fde0d6-0 EXUng\" data-component=\"image-block\"><div class=\"sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC\" data-testid=\"hero-image\"><img class=\"sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script\" src=\"/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png\"/><img alt=\"Getty Images/BBC/Naked A composite image of The Last Of Us stars and Alan Sugar\" class=\"sc-a34861b-0 efFcac\" loading=\"eager\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/98a3/live/50c993b0-16a8-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg.webp\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/98a3/live/50c993b0-16a8-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/98a3/live/50c993b0-16a8-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/98a3/live/50c993b0-16a8-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/98a3/live/50c993b0-16a8-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/98a3/live/50c993b0-16a8-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/98a3/live/50c993b0-16a8-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/98a3/live/50c993b0-16a8-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg.webp 1536w\"/>Getty Images/BBC/Naked</div></div></figure><div class=\"sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ\" data-component=\"text-block\"><p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ\">This week, <!-- -->The Last of Us<!-- --> returns to our screens -

The enhanced tier will cover countries and entities deemed a particular risk, which will require extra disclosures.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Ministers have announced that Iran and Russia will be on the enhanced tier, meaning anyone directed by those two countries to carry out activities in the UK will have to declare it or face five years in prison.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The government has yet to say anything about China\u2019s place in Firs, a matter which is subject to internal debate by ministers and officials weighing up security concerns against the economic benefits of closer ties with Beijing.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Financial services companies have privately argued against including China on the enhanced tier on the basis that they would have to fill out burdensome paperwork to justify business meetings.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">In an effort to strengthen security without compromising economic ties, ministers are considering including specific parts of the Chinese political system that have been accused of interference in the west on the enhanced tier.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Entities under consideration include Beijing\u2019s Ministry of State Security, which is its intelligence service, the United Front Work Department, often referred to as the international arm of the Chinese Communist party (CCP), and the People\u2019s Liberation Army, China\u2019s military. The government could also target the CCP as a whole.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe do not comment on security matters.\u201d</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">MI5\u2019s director general, Ken McCallum, said in a 2022 speech that \u201cthe Chinese intelligence services, or bodies within the CCP itself \u2013 such as its United Front Work Department (UFWD) \u2013 are mounting patient, well-funded, deceptive campaigns to buy and exert influence\u201d in the UK.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">McCallum said the UFWD aimed \u201cto amplify pro-CCP voices, and silence those that question the CCP\u2019s legitimacy or authority\u201d.

The shadow security minister, Tom Tugendhat, told the Commons last year that \u201cthe advice from MI5 was very, very clear. If China isn\u2019t in the enhanced tier, it\u2019s not worth having.\u201d</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">There are long-running tensions over the issue between the Home Office and the Treasury, which is relaying concerns about the potential burden on businesses.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Labour has pursued a rapprochement with Beijing since taking office. The foreign secretary, David Lammy, and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have made trips to China in an effort to maintain positive economic relations despite security concerns.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Douglas Alexander, a trade minister, became the latest government figure to visit China last week for talks amid the intensifying trade dispute between Beijing and Washington.

Retaliatory Chinese-imposed tariffs of 125% on US goods took effect on Saturday.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator, who is now a visiting senior fellow at the ISEAS \u2013 Yusof Ishak Institute, said that during Xi\u2019s tour of neighbouring countries, China would probably \u201ctry to position itself as the responsible leader of the rules-based trade system while painting the US as a rogue nation intent on taking a sledgehammer to trade relationships\u201d.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">It was unclear if meaningful, concrete agreements would emerge from the meetings, but they would be symbolically important, Olson added.</p><figure class=\"dcr-1your1i\" data-spacefinder-role=\"richLink\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement\" id=\"8019aba0-bca5-428a-a258-b979d0c8893a\"><div class=\"dcr-1kyw41h\" data-component=\"rich-link\" data-link-name=\"rich-link-9 | 9\" data-name=\"placeholder\" data-print-layout=\"hide\"><div class=\"dcr-cd8h3r\" data-format-design=\"0\" data-format-display=\"0\" data-format-theme=\"5\"><div class=\"dcr-1lhuo3r\"></div><div class=\"dcr-ut4tvs\"><div class=\"dcr-1h5b6rb\"><div class=\"dcr-1dgt1gs\">What does China really think about Trump?

However, trade in the region is closely intertwined with China, with countries from the regional bloc, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, counting as the biggest recipient of Chinese exports last year, according to China\u2019s customs data.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">There are concerns in the region that the 145% tariff imposed on China by the US could lead to a flood of cheap Chinese goods to nearby countries, undermining local industry.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Vietnam and many others in the region have traditionally sought to avoid taking sides between the US and China and will want to avoid antagonising either party, especially as it tries to persuade Washington to lower its 46% tariff.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Vietnam, where US exports account for 30% of GDP, had already made several concessions in the run-up to the tariff announcement, and was shocked by the severity of the tariff announced this month.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">It has since sent the deputy prime minister, Ho Duc Phoc, to Washington, offered to remove all tariffs on US imports and promised to buy more US goods, including defence and security products.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Vietnam is also preparing to crack down on Chinese goods being shipped from its territory to the US and tighten controls on sensitive exports to China, according to a Reuters report. This includes stricter rules relating to the export of dual-use goods such as semiconductors, which can be used for both civilian and military purposes, it was reported.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Vietnam was considered by many to be a winner in the trade war that occurred under the last Trump administration, as many companies moved there from China to skirt tariffs imposed by the US. However, this caused Vietnam\u2019s trade surplus with the US to surpass $123bn (\u00a394bn), leaving it especially vulnerable in the latest tariff announcement.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Vietnam, a communist one-party state, has set an ambitious target of becoming a high-income nation by 2045 \u2013 a goal driven by its exports, which would be derailed by the 46% tariff.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Cambodia and Malaysia are also seeking to negotiate with Trump. The US tariffs could devastate Cambodia\u2019s garment industry, which employs 750,000 workers. Cambodia is especially exposed as exports to the US account for 25% of the country\u2019s GDP. \n Xi last visited Vietnam in December but he has not travelled to Cambodia and Malaysia in nine and 12 years respectively. China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, said the visit to Malaysia would mark \u201can important milestone\u201d for the two countries, while describing Cambodia as an \u201ciron-clad friend\u201d.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The Malaysian communications minister, Fahmi Fadzil, said Xi\u2019s visit was \u201cpart of the government\u2019s efforts \u2026 to see better trade relations with various countries including China\u201d.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Cambodia is one of China\u2019s strongest allies in the region and it recently announced the completion of a China-backed project to upgrade a major naval base.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The country\u2019s prime minister, Hun Manet, who took the reins from his dictator father Hun Sen in 2023, said at the recent inauguration of a Chinese-funded road that \u201cCambodian-Chinese ties have not changed\u201d.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Xi\u2019s visits form part of a wider charm offensive pursued by China in the wake of the trade war. Xi also vowed to deepen China\u2019s strategic partnership with Indonesia in a call with that country\u2019s president, Prabowo Subianto, on Sunday, China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency reported.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">On Friday, Xi told the Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, during a meeting in Beijing that China and the EU should \u201cjointly oppose unilateral acts of bullying\u201d, Xinhua reported.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">China\u2019s premier, Li Qiang, spoke by phone with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, last week for talks that emphasised the responsibility of both parties to support a \u201cstrong reformed trading system, free, fair and founded on a level playing field\u201d.</p></div></div><div class=\"dcr-fckw05\"

Typical iPhone prices might have moved closer to $2,000 (\u00a31,528) than $1,000. The other option for Apple could have been to spread the cost across all of its global prices, but would the rest of the world accept paying a Trump tariff tax?<!-- --></p><p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ\">A very public repricing of iPhones has been avoided, but still may occur if, as the White House has said, the previously imposed 20% tariffs on China related to the powerful opioid fentanyl, remain in place.<!-- --></p><p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ\">Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, is a key player here.

The Trump administration is clearly spooked by the bond market reaction to the president's trade plans, and questions surrounding the safe haven status of US debt for investors.<!-- --></p><p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ\">In trying to stave off effective interest rates on bonds rising to 5%, the US needs deals more than just those in surplus countries.<!-- --></p><p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ\">Indeed this weekend's broad range of exemptions are in and of themselves an astonishing U-turn on the principle embodied in the notorious tariff chart held up by Trump in the Rose Garden. <!-- --></p><p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ\">Just under a quarter of China's total exports are now exempt from the 125% tariff, according to Capital Economics. <!-- --></p><p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ\">The consultancy suggests there are other big winners from the exemptions, with 64% of exports to the US from Taiwan, 44% from Malaysia, and just under 30% from both Vietnam and Thailand now also exempt.<!-- --></p><p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ\">The 10% universal tariff is now riddled with exemptions, and the biggest carve outs are for many nations with massive trade surpluses from electronics manufacturing.<!-- --></p><p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ\">The new tariff equation is to give an effective discount from the universal 10% (through exemptions) to those with the biggest surpluses. For example, Taiwan has a $74bn surplus with the US, and Vietnam a $124bn surplus.<!-- --></p><p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ\">This is the exact opposite of the infamous Navarro calculation from last week. In 10 days we've gone from the \"looters and pillagers\" will be hit the hardest, to (apart from China) those with big surpluses getting the biggest exemptions.<!-- --></p><p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ\">Meanwhile an ally such as the UK, which according to US figures has a $12bn deficit - i.e. the US sells more to the UK than the other way round, has a 25% tariff on cars, its biggest goods exports, with number two, medicines, in line for similar charges.<!-- --></p><p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ\">The White House has gone from clearly suggesting there would be no negotiation on the baseline 10% tariffs to offering exemptions to the very products causing the deficit the entire policy was supposed to solve.<!-- --></p><p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ\">This is a lot more than a \"row back\". Some have called it the \"Art of the Repeal\". The 4D chess has been replaced by someone playing one dimensional checkers, but unable to tell the difference between opposing pieces.<!-- --></p><p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ\">The US is now negotiating with the bond markets, and itself. The rest of the world will just see how this plays out now.<!-- --></p></div><div class=\"sc-18fde0d6-0 jVHuOl\" data-component=\"links-block\"><div class=\"sc-93223220-0 sc-46222299-0 ctbOlq hmFIuq\"><div class=\"sc-93223220-0 sc-46222299-1 hVPZMe jMSIqG\" data-testid=\"links-grid\"><div class=\"sc-c6f6255e-0 eGcloy\" data-indexcard=\"true\" data-testid=\"chester-card\"><div data-testid=\"anchor-inner-wrapper\"><div class=\"sc-417019fc-0 iZGTHs\" data-testid=\"chester-article\"><div class=\"sc-87075214-1 dRanZR\"><div class=\"sc-87075214-0 jvGDZA\"><h2 class=\"sc-87075214-3 eywmDE\" data-testid=\"card-headline\">Trump exempts smartphones and computers from new tariffs<!-- --></h2></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"sc-c6f6255e-0 eGcloy\" data-indexcard=\"true\" data-testid=\"chester-card\"><div data-testid=\"anchor-inner-wrapper\"><div class=\"sc-417019fc-0 iZGTHs\" data-testid=\"chester-article\"><div class=\"sc-87075214-1 dRanZR\"><div class=\"sc-87075214-0 jvGDZA\"><h2 class=\"sc-87075214-3 eywmDE\" data-testid=\"card-headline\">Why Trump is hitting China on trade - and what might happen next<!-- --></h2></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"sc-18fde0d6-0 jVHuOl\" data-component=\"tags\"><div class=\"sc-4b0aaa-0 dGavUm\"><div data-testid=\"anchor-inner-wrapper\">Trump tariffs</div><div data-testid=\"anchor-inner-wrapper\">China</div><div data-testid=\"anchor-inner-wrapper\">Donald Trump</div><div data-testid=\"anchor-inner-wrapper\">United States</div></div></div></article>", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7785/live/d1331660-184d-11f0-aab6-2bb36eb32e30.jpg", "source_url": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml"}, {"title": "Ecuador to deliver verdict on \u2018war on drugs\u2019 in knife-edge presidential runoff", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/13/ecuador-presidential-runoff-election-noboa-gonzalez", "published": "Sun, 13 Apr 2025 07:00:09 GMT", "source": "World news | The Guardian", "content": "<article class=\"dcr-1xdhyk6\" style=\"background-color:var(--article-background);\"><div class=\"dcr-wqti5a\" style=\"border-color:var(--article-border);background-color:var(--article-inner-background);\"><div class=\"dcr-2zxs1v\"><div class=\"dcr-1fnjjtg\" data-gu-name=\"media\" style=\"--grid-area:media;\"><div class=\"dcr-14emo0l\"><div class=\"dcr-hlfdy3\"><figure class=\"dcr-142siv7\" id=\"508099d4-b183-496c-8e57-a82ba4a4dda8\"><div class=\"dcr-1t8m8f2\" id=\"img-1\"><img alt=\"a woman raises her fist in front of a crowd of supporters\" class=\"dcr-evn1e9\" height=\"309.9568605622043\" loading=\"eager\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/208fddfcc80f7a6f74377c7a1af42964cf0f1609/0_0_3593_2395/master/3593.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"465\"/><div class=\"dcr-gup2gr\"><div class=\"dcr-zy1nbx\"> <div id=\"the-caption\">Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez, center, speaks to supporters at a rally in Guayaquil, Ecuador, on Thursday.

Abdominal fat disrupts how the body uses insulin, making it harder to control blood sugar.<!-- --></p><p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ\">Studies <!-- -->have found South Asians, including Indians, tend to have more body fat than white Caucasians at the same Body Mass Index. (BMI is a simple measure that assesses a person's weight in relation to their height.) <!-- --></p><p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ\">It's not just how much fat you have - it's where it goes. In South Asians, fat tends to collect around the trunk and under the skin, but not always deep in the abdomen as visceral fat.<!-- --></p><p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ\">Though South Asians may have less of the more harmful deep abdominal fat around organs like the liver and pancreas, studies show their larger, less efficient fat cells struggle to store fat under the skin. As a result, excess fat spills into vital organs that regulate metabolism - like the liver and pancreas - raising the risk of diabetes and heart disease.<!-- --></p></div><div class=\"sc-ad65179a-0 irVkns\" data-component=\"ad-slot\" data-testid=\"ad-unit\"><div class=\"dotcom-ad\" data-testid=\"dotcom-mid_2\" id=\"dotcom-mid_2\"></div></div><figure><div class=\"sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG\" data-component=\"image-block\"><div class=\"sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC\" data-testid=\"image\"><img class=\"sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script\" src=\"/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png\"/><img alt='Reuters A woman walks past a billboard in Mumbai April 19, 2007.

He had great love for his family, and he was a legend in his own right. You couldn\u2019t meet a nicer person \u2013 which makes the loss more difficult.\u201d</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Romeo began his career in 1965 as the lead vocalist for the Emotions, before his music became synonymous with the Jamaican social democracy movement of the 1970s. His song Let the Power Fall on I became a ballad for Jamaica\u2019s People\u2019s National party during its successful 1972 election campaign.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">His 1976 album War Ina Babylon, released on Island Records and backed by Jamaican band the Upsetters, is widely regarded as a classic of the roots reggae era.

From this Sunday, organisers of the 2025 Exposition in Osaka will be hoping that appeal will put the event\u2019s unsettled preparations in the shade for a six-month celebration of our common humanity.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The western Japan city is preparing to host its second World Expo, 55 years after the first was held in a country eager to capitalise on fading memories of the second world war as it embarked on its postwar journey to become an industrial and technological powerhouse.</p><div id=\"sign-in-gate\"></div><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Then, 64 million people descended on Osaka\u2019s northern suburbs to view the Tower of the Sun \u2013 still a popular site in the commemorative park \u2013 and a moon rock retrieved by Apollo 12.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The 2025 version opens under a geopolitical cloud dark enough to cast a shadow over the 960-acre grounds on the reclaimed Yumeshima (\u201cDream Island\u201d), a former dumping ground for industrial waste and, for successive Osaka governments, a plot of land in perennial need of a purpose.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The expo is the most convincing attempt yet to make use of the unloved island, until now a blot on the landscape, with Osaka\u2019s industrial skyline on one side and the busy shipping lanes of the Seto inland sea on the other. In its mission to bring people together, 150 countries and regions will showcase the best of their culture and technology, albeit with an acknowledgment that humanity is more divided than at any time most of the millions of expected visitors can recall.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">They should, though, marvel at a Martian meteorite discovered by Japanese scientists in Antarctica in 2000, interact with androids that could one day live in their homes, view a beating artificial heart made of stem cells and \u2013 not for the \u00adfaint-hearted \u2013 stare back at an image of what they might look like in 25 years\u2019 time.</p><figure class=\"dcr-173mewl\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\" id=\"74740d47-408b-4890-9595-b872b95f5cf2\"><div class=\"dcr-1t8m8f2\" id=\"img-2\"><img alt=\"A woman poses for a photo in front of Myaku-Myaku, the mascot of the 2025 Osaka Expo, during a media preview day on Wednesday.\" class=\"dcr-evn1e9\" height=\"296.07804232804233\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83395bd2cd4c85a14430fe820469a10bcf29f859/0_0_6048_4024/master/6048.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\"/></div>A woman poses for a photo in front of Myaku-Myaku, the mascot of the 2025 Osaka Expo, during a media preview day on Wednesday. Photograph: Richard A Brooks/AFP/Getty Images</figure><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Viewed from the grand ring \u2013 a 2km (1.24 mile) wooden promenade that encircles the waterfront site \u2013 there is an incongruity to the 150 pavilions, from the flamboyance of Turkmenistan to the neat wooden contours of Japan. And all separated by lots of Tarmac and concrete. The earthquake-resistant wooden \u201cskywalk\u201d, though, is a feat of craftsmanship, built with a traditional joinery method used in the construction of ancient shrines and temples, its network of cypress, cedar and pine beams destined to become a shady oasis when Japan unleashes its brutal summer heat midway through the \u00a0event.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The expo theme\u2019s tagline \u2013 \u201ctowards a brighter future for all\u201d \u2013 feels laughably elusive, but credit should go to the organisers for addressing the harsh realities of the world outside.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The blue and yellow sign over Ukraine\u2019s booth states that the country is \u201cnot for sale\u201d, echoing comments from the country\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Russia has chosen not to take part.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">In August visitors will be able to take part in a virtual reality experience corner for conflict zones in Gaza, in a space currently devoted to 80 years of the United Nations and its constituent departments and agencies, including Unrwa.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Palestine\u2019s space is to be found in the far corner of a shared pavilion, although its organisers claim the shipment of several planned exhibits has been delayed by Israeli authorities, which is denied by Israel, whose pavilion includes a stone from the Western Wall in Jerusalem.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The reported delay is in keeping with Osaka\u2019s bumpy road to Expo 2025. Construction was hit by labour shortages and the soaring cost of building materials \u2013 the project\u2019s initial price tag of \u00a5125bn has soared to \u00a5235bn (from \u00a3666m to \u00a31.25bn) \u2013 while interest among the Japanese public has so far been lukewarm.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The 1970 Osaka Expo\u2019s 64 million visitors was a record until Shanghai in 2010. So far, only 8.7m advance tickets have been sold for 2025, well below the pre-sales target of 14m.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Last week, as TV crews swarmed around the site, workers were still flattening strips of tactile paving for visitors with visual \u00adimpairments, while activity around incomplete pavilions gave them the feel of a supermarket tradesmen\u2019s entrance. The 1,500 trees comprising the Forest of Tranquillity will need time to bed in.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Organisers have been given last-minute jitters by the discovery of potentially explosive concentrations of methane gas, as well as concern about overcrowding at the new subway station serving the site and, on social media, disbelief at the lack of cubicle walls in the children\u2019s lavatories.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The host nation, though, has deployed its soft power to good effect: the world\u2019s longest conveyor belt sushi, a giant Gundam robot, 32 sculptures of Hello Kitty dressed as different types of algae to symbolise the plant\u2019s versatility, and an upgraded version of a \u201chuman washing machine\u201d that proved a hit at the 1970 event.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">In a country addicted to yuru-kyara [mascot characters], the biggest attraction could turn out to be Myaku-Myaku, a red and blue figure with five googly eyes that was ridiculed when it was selected as the expo\u2019s official mascot. Since then, the mysterious creature, purportedly \u201cborn from the fusion of cells and water\u201d, has won over the Japanese public and is now the centre of a large merchandise empire \u2026 and the face of manhole covers across Osaka.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Sou Fujimoto, the exposition\u2019s architectural mastermind, conceded the event was opening at a time when minds are focused on wars, real and commercial. \u201cThe whole global \u00adsituation is very unstable,\u201d he told CNN. But he added: \u201cI believe this is a really precious opportunity to show so many countries can come together in one place and think about our future together.\u201d</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">That lofty vision will be fleeting, however. The pavilions \u2013 and Fujimoto\u2019s \u201csustainable\u201d edifice \u2013 will be dismantled later this year to make way for Japan\u2019s first casino. But as gambles go, the longer odds could be on selling the idea that the expo movement\u2019s bricks-and-\u00admortar appeal for global unity will strike a chord in a hyper-connected, but fractured, world.</p></div></div><div class=\"dcr-fckw05\" data-print-layout=\"hide\">Explore more on these topics<div class=\"dcr-11qmbjk\"><ul class=\"dcr-1rrvs2w\"><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">Japan</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">The Observer</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">Asia Pacific</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">news</li></ul></div><div class=\"dcr-nu129i\">Share<div class=\"src-button-space\"></div><div class=\"dcr-zhx6xs\">Reuse this content</div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"dcr-bcwpw1\" data-gu-name=\"right-column\" style=\"--grid-area:right-column;\"><div class=\"dcr-tn16h9\"><div class=\"dcr-1e3xwa3\" data-container=\"most-viewed-right-container\"></div></div></div></div></div></article>", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2579edef6ca82e57ea052a0c4dee53a7b7dcbf40/0_25_5706_3424/master/5706.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2e51a1b62899ad80062c65fd7334c2f3", "source_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss"}, {"title": "Ted Kotcheff, director of First Blood, Weekend at Bernie\u2019s and Wake in Fright, dies aged 94", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/apr/12/ted-kotcheff-director-of-first-blood-weekend-at-bernies-and-wake-in-fright-dies-aged-94", "published": "Sat, 12 Apr 2025 11:46:53 GMT", "source": "World news | The Guardian", "content": "<article class=\"dcr-1xdhyk6\" style=\"background-color:var(--article-background);\"><div class=\"dcr-wqti5a\" style=\"border-color:var(--article-border);background-color:var(--article-inner-background);\"><div class=\"dcr-2zxs1v\"><div class=\"dcr-1fnjjtg\" data-gu-name=\"media\" style=\"--grid-area:media;\"><div class=\"dcr-14emo0l\"><div class=\"dcr-hlfdy3\"><figure class=\"dcr-142siv7\" id=\"d212871a-97e9-41be-b871-b07cabd955b8\"><div class=\"dcr-1t8m8f2\" id=\"img-1\"><img alt=\"Ted Kotcheff in 2012 at a screening of Wake in Fright in New York City.\" class=\"dcr-evn1e9\" height=\"279.15500000000003\" loading=\"eager\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d103489c10d79e61fe2d24a349fb3baae5f04faa/0_47_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"465\"/><div class=\"dcr-gup2gr\"><div class=\"dcr-zy1nbx\"> <div id=\"the-caption\">Ted Kotcheff in 2012 at a screening of Wake in Fright in New York City.

His daughter Kate Kotcheff told the Canadian Press that he had died of heart failure on Thursday in Nuevo Vallarta, Mexico, where he lived. His son Thomas said: \u201cHe died of old age, peacefully, and surrounded by loved ones.\u201d</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">In an amazingly varied career, Kotcheff\u2019s work ranged from hardhitting TV plays and low-budget features in the UK, to hit Hollywood comedies and prestige-laden award-winners and cult films.

After earning a degree in English literature from Toronto University, Kotcheff joined the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in the early 1950s, part of a remarkable generation that included Norman Jewison, Arthur Hiller, Sidney J Furie and Alvin Rakoff. Like them, he felt he had to move away to further his career, and Kotcheff came to London in 1957 and began making TV plays for strands including Hour of Mystery, Armchair Theatre and ITV Playhouse. These included an adaptation of Eugene O\u2019Neill\u2019s Emperor Jones in 1958, written by Terry Southern and starring Kenneth Spencer and Harry H Corbett, No Trams to Lime Street in 1959, written by Alun Owen, and \u2013 infamously \u2013 Underground in 1958, in which actor Gareth Jones collapsed and died during a live transmission.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Kotcheff moved into features in the early 60s, making his debut with the 1962 comedy Tiara Tahiti, starring James Mason and John Mills, following it up with Life at the Top, the sequel to hit kitchen sink drama Room at the Top, in 1965, and the race-issue drama Two Gentlemen Sharing in 1969. In the same period Kotcheff also directed the original production of Lionel Bart\u2019s celebrated musical Maggie May, which premiered in 1964. Kotcheff continued to work in TV, directing Ingrid Bergman in an adaptation of Jean Cocteau\u2019s La Voix Humaine in 1967, and achieving perhaps his high point with a contribution to Play for Today in 1971: Edna the Inebriate Woman, starring Patricia Hayes as a homeless alcoholic.</p><figure class=\"dcr-173mewl\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\" id=\"7fc612f5-c9ed-4a55-883e-4417f0dc5dfd\"><div class=\"dcr-1t8m8f2\" id=\"img-3\"><img alt=\"Sylvester Stallone in First Blood.\" class=\"dcr-evn1e9\" height=\"267.06452782309225\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/951b81241c938413950a71dca62826a7b62916b2/0_186_5517_3311/master/5517.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\"/></div>Sylvester Stallone in First Blood. Photograph: ScreenProd/Photononstop/Alamy</figure><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">However his career had taken an unexpected detour in the same year with the cult Australian film Wake in Fright, for which he was offered the job to direct despite never having visited the country. Despite being poorly received in its home country due to its uncompromising depiction of a brutally cruel Australian outback, including notorious scenes of a kangaroo hunt, Wake in Fright was selected for the Cannes film festival and went on to become celebrated as a landmark film, both as part of the Australian new wave of the 1970s and as a pioneering entry in the \u201cOzploitation\u201d subgenre.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">In 1974 Kotcheff finally realised his ambition of making a successful Canadian feature film with The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz; starring Richard Dreyfuss, it was adapted from a novel by his friend (and former housemate in London) Mordecai Richler, with whom he had worked on a string of British productions \u2013 including an Armchair Theatre adaptation of Duddy Kravitz in 1961. The film won the Golden Bear at the Berlin film festival and was a major commercial success in Canada.</p><figure class=\"dcr-173mewl\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\" id=\"83a1a1f0-90c3-46cd-9052-2957f07a2579\"><div class=\"dcr-1t8m8f2\" id=\"img-4\"><img alt=\"Donald Pleasence and Gary Bond in Wake in Fright.\" class=\"dcr-evn1e9\" height=\"266.84116597263534\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1cf667a1b0ad0a01e9d3706046b0151b693604d/0_9_1681_1008/master/1681.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\"/></div>Donald Pleasence and Gary Bond in Wake in Fright. Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy</figure><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">As a result, Hollywood took notice and Kotcheff was hired to make satirical comedy Fun with Dick and Jane, starring George Segal and Jane Fonda as a successful married couple who turn to crime after Segal is fired. It was a hit on its release in 1977, and Kotcheff followed it up with another Segal comedy Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe? and Nick Nolte American football film North Dallas Forty.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Kotcheff then released arguably his most influential film: the Sylvester Stallone action film First Blood, which had numerous directors and lead actors attached to it before Kotcheff offered the role to Stallone and production got underway in 1981. A depiction of an emotionally embattled Vietnam veteran, First Blood was a sizeable hit and spawned two sequels, including Rambo: First Blood Part II which became a career-defining success for Stallone in 1985.

Under the canal\u2019s neutrality treaty, no foreign power can \u201cmaintain military forces, defense sites and military installations within its national territory\u201d, and the US comments have prompted outrage in Panama.</p><figure class=\"dcr-1your1i\" data-spacefinder-role=\"richLink\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement\" id=\"c088e12d-c72c-4fc6-881e-634877942c1b\"><div class=\"dcr-1kyw41h\" data-component=\"rich-link\" data-link-name=\"rich-link-4 | 4\" data-name=\"placeholder\" data-print-layout=\"hide\"><div class=\"dcr-cd8h3r\" data-format-design=\"0\" data-format-display=\"0\" data-format-theme=\"5\"><div class=\"dcr-1lhuo3r\"></div><div class=\"dcr-ut4tvs\"><div class=\"dcr-1h5b6rb\"><div class=\"dcr-1dgt1gs\">Pentagon chief says US could \u2018revive\u2019 Panama bases</div></div><div class=\"dcr-eurq8n\"><div class=\"dcr-fkf7vq\">Read more</div></div></div></div></div></figure><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">\u201cThis is a camouflaged invasion,\u201d said Ricardo Lombana, the leader of the opposition Other Way Movement. \u201cAn invasion without firing a shot, but with a cudgel and threats.\u201d</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">At a Wednesday press conference to announce the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the US, Panama\u2019s minister of public security, Frank Abrego, said the agreement would not impinge on his nation\u2019s sovereignty and that the country would not accept military bases.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">However, a full text of the MOU included aerial photos of Fort Sherman, Rodman naval base and Howard air force base, with areas outlined for \u201ctraining\u201d, \u201chumanitarian activities\u201d and the \u201cinstallation of US property\u201d.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The Panamanian government says they are not \u201cmilitary bases\u201d and that the deal is temporary, but opposition parties have rejected such claims.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">\u201cIf you have an installation which is for use of foreign soldiers and they have control over what happens inside \u2013 and Panama has to ask in advance to enter \u2013 that\u2019s a military base,\u201d said Lombana.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">For many Panamanians, the return of US armed forces \u2013 even for supposed \u201cjoint operations\u201d \u2013 will bring back uncomfortable memories of 1989\u2019s Operation Just Cause, when American troops killed hundreds of civilians.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">A second agreement allows US navy ships to be reimbursed for the fees they pay to the canal. That preferential treatment would appear to violate the neutrality treatment and could open the door to further attempts to negotiate down the fees charged by the canal.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">On Thursday a local lawyer filed a legal case against the Panamanian president, Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, accusing him of \u201ccrimes against the international personality of the state\u201d.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Frustration is growing over the government\u2019s handling of the diplomatic crisis. Since Trump declared his plan to \u201ctake back\u201d the Panama canal on his 20 January inauguration speech, all communication on the topic has been through Mulino and the details of negotiations kept largely secret.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">This has led to serious differences in the US and Panamanian accounts of those negotiations. When the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, visited in early February, Mulino told press that the meeting had been \u201cvery cordial\u201d and that the canal was not under threat. Later, however, Rubio said the situation around the canal was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and Trump continued to call for the return of the canal.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The latest example came on Tuesday when two different statements concerning Hegseth\u2019s meeting with Mulino were published. In the Panamanian version, Hegseth was said to have recognized Panama\u2019s \u201cinalienable sovereignty\u201d over the canal, but those words were absent from the secretary of defense\u2019s statement and Hegseth refused to acknowledge Panamanian ownership of the canal at Wednesday\u2019s press conference. Panama says that the US omitted the phrase from the agreed joint statement.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Mulino has also opted to avoid engaging with other countries \u2013 such as Canada and Mexico \u2013 to gain international support for his country\u2019s cause.</p><figure class=\"dcr-1your1i\" data-spacefinder-role=\"richLink\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement\" id=\"858c88a8-fca9-43eb-b031-b98f27986cb2\"><div class=\"dcr-1kyw41h\" data-component=\"rich-link\" data-link-name=\"rich-link-17 | 17\" data-name=\"placeholder\" data-print-layout=\"hide\"><div class=\"dcr-cd8h3r\" data-format-design=\"0\" data-format-display=\"0\" data-format-theme=\"5\"><div class=\"dcr-1lhuo3r\"></div><div class=\"dcr-ut4tvs\"><div class=\"dcr-1h5b6rb\"><div class=\"dcr-1dgt1gs\">US-Panama relationship was \u2018very strong\u2019.

The country requires transparency in order to achieve unity against this threat to our sovereignty.\u201d</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Even before Hegseth\u2019s visit, Mulino had faced heavy local criticism for offering concessions to the US without gaining firm assurances over the future of the canal.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Two-thirds of Panamanians disapprove of the way he is running the country. In addition to the diplomatic crisis he has passed an unpopular social security reform and angered environmentalists by opening talks with a copper mine closed down in 2023 due to popular protest. He lacks the backing of many of his party\u2019s deputies in congress who are loyal to his political patron, Ricardo Martinelli, who has been residing in the Nicaraguan embassy to escape corruption charges and recently saw his attempt to gain exile in that country rejected.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Popular demonstrations against US policy and the handling of the government are expected on Saturday.</p></div></div><div class=\"dcr-fckw05\" data-print-layout=\"hide\">Explore more on these topics<div class=\"dcr-11qmbjk\"><ul class=\"dcr-1rrvs2w\"><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">Panama</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">Trump administration</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">US foreign policy</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">Pete Hegseth</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">Americas</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">Donald Trump</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">US military</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">news</li></ul></div><div class=\"dcr-nu129i\">Share<div class=\"src-button-space\"></div><div class=\"dcr-zhx6xs\">Reuse this content</div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"dcr-bcwpw1\" data-gu-name=\"right-column\" style=\"--grid-area:right-column;\"><div class=\"dcr-tn16h9\"><div class=\"dcr-1e3xwa3\" data-container=\"most-viewed-right-container\"></div></div></div></div></div></article>", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bf75c775d223205be1dc61e405462971266fcc2/0_322_4827_2895/master/4827.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=560d918d4f7f03ff4d73c54f899d89e6", "source_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss"}, {"title": "Homeland security apparently used British man\u2019s tattoo to identify alleged gang members", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/11/dhs-british-tattoo-identify-alleged-gang-venezuela", "published": "Fri, 11 Apr 2025 16:26:35 GMT", "source": "World news | The Guardian", "content": "<article class=\"dcr-1xdhyk6\" style=\"background-color:var(--article-background);\"><div class=\"dcr-wqti5a\" style=\"border-color:var(--article-border);background-color:var(--article-inner-background);\"><div class=\"dcr-2zxs1v\"><div class=\"dcr-1fnjjtg\" data-gu-name=\"media\" style=\"--grid-area:media;\"><div class=\"dcr-14emo0l\"><div class=\"dcr-hlfdy3\"><figure class=\"dcr-142siv7\" id=\"01438df4-c609-4a07-8fcd-b2b0f08bc50b\"><div class=\"dcr-1t8m8f2\" id=\"img-1\"><img alt=\"a slide from a slideshow showing tattoos to identify gang members\" class=\"dcr-evn1e9\" height=\"349.2906976744186\" loading=\"eager\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a01b69d5afd9a5d48c6424be533d13aa1cf36387/0_0_1720_1292/master/1720.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"465\"/><div class=\"dcr-gup2gr\"><div class=\"dcr-zy1nbx\"> <div id=\"the-caption\">The tattoo featuring a clock, indicated in red, was also included in a Texas department of public safety document to identify gang affiliation.

class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Among them appears to be Belton\u2019s tattoo, which depicts a clock face with the date and time of his daughter\u2019s birth, as well as other tattoos which include stars, skulls, the Michael Jordan \u201cjump man\u201d basketball logo, crowns and guns.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The BBC reported that it conducted reverse image searches for some of the tattoos depicted, and discovered that several of the images first appeared on tattoo websites with no obvious connections to TdA or any other gangs.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">They traced the image of Belton\u2019s tattoo to an Instagram post from nearly a decade ago by a Nottingham-based UK tattoo artist.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Belton said that initially he found it a \u201cbit strange\u201d and a \u201cbit funny\u201d that his tattoo was in the document, but now he is worried about a planned family trip to Miami in August with his wife and daughter, and that it might turn into a

hundreds of individuals it alleges to be members of TdA, sending them to a notorious prison in El Salvador without even a court hearing.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">But in recent weeks, questions regarding the accuracy of these gang allegations have intensified, with lawyers arguing that some of the deportees were misidentified as a result of their tattoos.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Lawyers

For Brice Nguema, the junta leader turned civilian head of state, it could be a chance to cement his democratic credentials.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Last November, 860,000 registered voters approved a referendum for a new constitution with two seven-year presidential terms and an amnesty for participants in the removal of Ali Bongo, who had succeeded his father in 2009. Officials are yet to release data on the updated voters\u2019 register but previously said they expected an additional 300,000 new registrations, including from those who have recently come of age.</p><div id=\"sign-in-gate\"></div><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Observer missions are already in place, including that of an eight-person Commonwealth team led by Danny Faure, a former president of Seychelles.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Four independents are in the race for president but analysts say the favourite is Nguema. Since coming to power, 50-year-old Nguema has styled himself as an anti-corruption crusader who had to resort to a coup to end an unpopular family dynasty, despite also being a cousin to Bongo. In October 2023, he made headlines for reportedly refusing to draw a salary for the presidency.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Those announcements drew plaudits in the oil-rich central African state where a third of the 2.3 million people live in poverty.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">\u201cGabonese tell themselves that someone who works with this much ardour is trying to transform things,\u201d Joseph Tonda, a sociologist at Omar Bongo University in Libreville, told Reuters news agency earlier this month.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">But like his cousin, Nguema has maintained close ties with France even in the face of high anti-French sentiments in the region. And a 2020 investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) revealed multimillion-dollar assets abroad, believed to be the proceeds of embezzlement during his time in the presidential guard.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">His closest challenger is the ex-prime minister Alain Claude Bilie By Nze, who was in government until the coup. Nze, who has campaigned as a pragmatic veteran seeking to create jobs and reduce the size of government, has also tried to dissociate himself from the old guard.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Other candidates include the former tax official Joseph Lapens\u00e9e Essingone and St\u00e9phane Germain Iloko, previously a member of the former ruling Gabonese Democratic party (PDG).</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The coup, one of a string of military takeovers in west and central Africa between 2020 and 2023, was well received in Gabon, with many citizens trooping to the streets of Port Gentil and Libreville, its two biggest cities.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">But there are concerns that Nguema may also be using the same Bongo playbook of muzzling dissent.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">In particular, the Union for Democracy and Social Integration (UDIS) party \u2013 once allied with the former ruling party \u2013 has accused the administration of targeting its exiled leader, Herv\u00e9 Patrick Opiangah, who is the subject of a criminal investigation for alleged incest and undermining state security.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Opiangah, 54, a former mining minister, has proclaimed his innocence and filed a complaint with the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Edmond Ngadi, a UDIS spokesperson who has called the matter a \u201cstate conspiracy\u201d, said Opiangah was being targeted for mobilising for people to vote no during the 16 November referendum.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">\u201cThis is a blatant violation of human rights \u2026 he is a Gabonese citizen who simply asks to return to his country safely to be able to secure his family, secure his businesses and also participate in the life of his country,\u201d Ngadi said.</p></div></div><div class=\"dcr-fckw05\" data-print-layout=\"hide\">Explore more on these topics<div class=\"dcr-11qmbjk\"><ul class=\"dcr-1rrvs2w\"><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">Gabon</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">Africa</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">news</li></ul></div><div class=\"dcr-nu129i\">Share<div class=\"src-button-space\"></div><div class=\"dcr-zhx6xs\">Reuse this content</div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"dcr-bcwpw1\" data-gu-name=\"right-column\" style=\"--grid-area:right-column;\"><div class=\"dcr-tn16h9\"><div class=\"dcr-1e3xwa3\" data-container=\"most-viewed-right-container\"></div></div></div></div></div></article>", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6439e28de7e379a92bca620a186abedf3bb51adf/0_217_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d04684f4862bb844c98a46d471075020", "source_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss"}, {"title": "Zimbabwe starts compensating white farmers 25 years after land seizures", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/11/zimbabwe-starts-compensating-white-farmers-25-years-after-land-seizures", "published": "Fri, 11 Apr 2025 11:46:57 GMT", "source": "World news | The Guardian", "content": "<article class=\"dcr-1xdhyk6\" style=\"background-color:var(--article-background);\"><div class=\"dcr-wqti5a\" style=\"border-color:var(--article-border);background-color:var(--article-inner-background);\"><div class=\"dcr-2zxs1v\"><div class=\"dcr-1fnjjtg\" data-gu-name=\"media\" style=\"--grid-area:media;\"><div class=\"dcr-14emo0l\"><div class=\"dcr-hlfdy3\"><figure class=\"dcr-142siv7\" id=\"1e76f043-bedd-467b-b131-a1225614e976\"><div class=\"dcr-1t8m8f2\" id=\"img-1\"><img alt=\"Black people in farmland with sign saying: Welcome the JM Tongogara Farm\" class=\"dcr-evn1e9\" height=\"279.04541015625\" loading=\"eager\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cb4a04a135c2838c5ae0c5a8331f36e82470b98/0_105_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"465\"/><div class=\"dcr-gup2gr\"><div class=\"dcr-zy1nbx\"> <div id=\"the-caption\">Independence war veterans rename Parklands Farm, near Harare, in March 2000 after the liberation war commander Josiah Tongogara.

That is much lower than the current yield on a two-year US treasury bond of about 3.8%.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Zimbabwe\u2019s finance minister, Mthuli Ncube, said: \u201cThe payments will continue. We are very serious about this.\u201d</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Mugabe\u2019s government seized more than 4,000 mostly white-owned farms, often violently, from about the year 2000 to redistribute to black people in what it claimed was restitution for the dispossession of British colonial rule.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">However, Mugabe and his cronies took nearly 40% of the 14m hectares (about 35m acres) confiscated for themselves, according to a 2010 investigation by a local news outlet, ZimOnline. Agricultural production, which had accounted for 40% of exports, plunged and the economy collapsed, with hyperinflation reaching a staggering 500bn% in 2008.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Zimbabwe cannot borrow from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund as it has been in arrears since 2000 and 2001, respectively. Government debt was $21bn late last year, about half of which was arrears and penalties.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The compensation payments to the displaced farmers are one of the requirements of international lenders to start a debt restructuring process with Zimbabwe, including a new IMF programme.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Andrew Pascoe, who signed the 2020 compensation deal while head of the Commercial Farmers\u2019 Union, confirmed the first payments had been received on 24 March and thanked Zimbabwe\u2019s government, in comments included in the ministry of finance statement. He said: \u201cWe are extremely grateful.\u201d</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">However, Tony Hawkins, a retired University of Zimbabwe economics professor, called the payments a \u201cpublicity stunt\u201d, noting that the US could block an IMF programme. A US law \u201crestricts US support for multilateral financing to Zimbabwe until Zimbabwe makes concrete governance and economic reforms\u201d, according to the US state department.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Of using government bonds to pay farmers, Hawkins said: \u201cWe continue to accumulate arrears because we are unable to service our foreign debt, so we can\u2019t really afford to take on new debt commitments \u2026 It\u2019s derisory, the more you look at it.\u201d</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">About 1,000 former farmers had signed up for compensation, said Harry Orphanides, one of Pascoe\u2019s co-negotiators. He said: \u201cLook, it\u2019s not a perfect deal. But there was no other alternative.\u201d</p></div></div><div class=\"dcr-fckw05\" data-print-layout=\"hide\">Explore more on these topics<div class=\"dcr-11qmbjk\"><ul class=\"dcr-1rrvs2w\"><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">Zimbabwe</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">Land rights</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">Race</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">International Monetary Fund (IMF)</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">Agriculture</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">Farming</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">World Bank</li><li class=\"dcr-hj8byr\">news</li></ul></div><div class=\"dcr-nu129i\">Share<div class=\"src-button-space\"></div><div class=\"dcr-zhx6xs\">Reuse this content</div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"dcr-bcwpw1\" data-gu-name=\"right-column\" style=\"--grid-area:right-column;\"><div class=\"dcr-tn16h9\"><div class=\"dcr-1e3xwa3\" data-container=\"most-viewed-right-container\"></div></div></div></div></div></article>", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cb4a04a135c2838c5ae0c5a8331f36e82470b98/0_105_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ee2f7704e74499a0b573b0937ad2eb0a", "source_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss"}, {"title": "Weather tracker: early heatwave sweeps northern India", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/11/weather-tracker-early-heatwave-sweeps-northern-india", "published": "Fri, 11 Apr 2025 09:18:39 GMT", "source": "World news | The Guardian", "content": "<article class=\"dcr-1xdhyk6\" style=\"background-color:var(--article-background);\"><div class=\"dcr-wqti5a\" style=\"border-color:var(--article-border);background-color:var(--article-inner-background);\"><div class=\"dcr-2zxs1v\"><div class=\"dcr-1fnjjtg\" data-gu-name=\"media\" style=\"--grid-area:media;\"><div class=\"dcr-14emo0l\"><div class=\"dcr-hlfdy3\"><figure class=\"dcr-142siv7\" id=\"a8bbaa57-ecbd-4f23-804a-513361baa080\"><div class=\"dcr-1t8m8f2\" id=\"img-1\"><img alt=\"A man carries a sack on his shoulder in front of signage of a woman drinking from a green bottle\" class=\"dcr-evn1e9\" height=\"279.06167108753317\" loading=\"eager\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0cb9335e423dc613a6edb0b6744e5ad56d4ec8d/0_0_4524_2715/master/4524.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"465\"/><div class=\"dcr-gup2gr\"><div class=\"dcr-zy1nbx\"> <div id=\"the-caption\">A hot afternoon in Kolkata, India.

Farther south, Jaipur exceeded 40C for five consecutive days from Sunday, with a maximum temperature of 43C recorded on Wednesday, almost 5C above the average April high.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The Indian meteorology bureau said last week that most parts of the country would experience an intense heatwave this summer, with two to four more such days than normal.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The extreme early heat this week triggered severe thunderstorms across Bihar, including in Patna. At least 19 people have died in the past two days amid frequent lightning, significant hail and strong winds.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">There was extensive damage to crops \u2013 including wheat, mango and lychee \u2013 weeks before the harvest. Stormy conditions are likely to persist across Bihar until Saturday, owing to a low-pressure system over the west-central Bay of Bengal.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Meanwhile, parts of east Africa are experiencing higher-than-average temperatures, which could approach the April record.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">In Mali, the national meteorological agency issued an extreme weather warning covering the entire country from Wednesday to Sunday. Maximum temperatures are expected to reach 40-47C for at least three consecutive days.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">This is comparable to average temperatures during the height of summer in June and July, whereas April averages tend to be 38-40C.

Despite being jailed, attacked, shot, and facing threats of violence, including from Museveni\u2019s son, Wine said he felt he had little choice but to try to advance the hope for change that was energising Ugandans, especially the young.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">\u201cWe cannot just give the election to General Museveni,\u201d he said, in an interview with the Guardian.</p><div id=\"sign-in-gate\"></div><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">The leader of the National Unity Platform (NUP) party, Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, said he expected the January 2026 election, in which Museveni has said he will stand for what would be his seventh term in office, to be bloody.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">But, with 80% of the Ugandan population under the age of 35, Wine believes change can come.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">\u201cYoung people are so hopeful because they see the possibility,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately the good will of the people is what is important for this election and for our campaign. They know if you are not given freedom, you don\u2019t have a life.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">\u201cI think I stir a lot of hope because I don\u2019t shut my big mouth, and that\u2019s a big challenge to the regime.\u201d</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Museveni, now in his eighties, has held power in Uganda since 1986, one of the world\u2019s longest standing national leaders.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">In 2021, Africa Elections Watch observers said the election was conducted with \u201cirregularities\u201d, while the US state department called it \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d. During that campaign, Wine was imprisoned and faced attacks and death threats.</p><figure class=\"dcr-173mewl\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\" id=\"ad08ec06-7525-4ab4-9917-a5153ef6891b\"><div class=\"dcr-1t8m8f2\" id=\"img-2\"><img alt=\"Armed guards arrest Bobi Wine in a street\" class=\"dcr-evn1e9\" height=\"308.4485714285714\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fbf278776818c1e019f31d16db3237c1793863f/0_0_3500_2426/master/3500.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\"/></div>Bobi Wine is detained during an anti-government demonstration in Kampala, 15 March 2021. Photograph: Abubaker Lubowa/Reuters</figure><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">\u201cI am worried about what is ahead, of course,\u201d said Wine. \u201cThinking about how brutal it is going to be, it\u2019s going to be terrible. We are already seeing signs it will be more brutal. Last month, we had a byelection and one of my MPs died. Died after being tortured by the regime. Journalists were very badly beaten and observers from the US embassy had to leave the field.\u201d</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">Among the enemies Wine and his NUP party have made is Museveni\u2019s son, 50-year-old Muhoozi Kainerugaba. He was made chief of defence forces by his father and is also chair of the Patriotic League of Uganda, which lobbies heavily for him to succeed the presidency. Kainerugaba has made vicious public threats to Wine on his social media accounts, including saying he was keeping a bullet specially for him.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">\u201cMore reason to stand up,\u201d said Wine.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">\u201cI am convinced that if the world stands firm with us, 2026 could be a turning point. If the world leaders do not stand on the side of oppression, but help; if they criticise and distance themselves from the absence of human rights and democracy.</p><figure class=\"dcr-173mewl\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\" id=\"c54c8535-36f4-4173-8c8e-1ea0bccada93\"><div class=\"dcr-1t8m8f2\" id=\"img-3\"><img alt=\"Wine stand up in an open-topped car at the head of a convoy of cars, with his fist raised in salute.

If lifesaving aid is cut then how will aid for democracy fare?</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">\u201cAid cuts are going to impact Uganda very negatively. But also much aid is diverted to support this corrupt regime. The aid that was helping in the health sector is not there any more, so we are going to have less medicines and more bullets,\u201d he said.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">\u201cWe have always been asking for targeted sanctions on those in the regime and asking the US not to send their taxpayers\u2019 money to be spent on things that can be used against our people. The guns that kill our people are American guns. The soldiers who torture our people are trained in America.</p><figure class=\"dcr-1your1i\" data-spacefinder-role=\"richLink\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement\" id=\"225a7f0b-f872-4cf2-b8d8-79b3b47eac2a\"><div class=\"dcr-1kyw41h\" data-component=\"rich-link\" data-link-name=\"rich-link-18 | 18\" data-name=\"placeholder\" data-print-layout=\"hide\"><div class=\"dcr-cd8h3r\" data-format-design=\"0\" data-format-display=\"0\" data-format-theme=\"5\"><div class=\"dcr-1lhuo3r\"></div><div class=\"dcr-ut4tvs\"><div class=\"dcr-1h5b6rb\"><div class=\"dcr-1dgt1gs\">Lawyer for Ugandan opposition politician \u2018arrested and tortured\u2019</div></div><div class=\"dcr-eurq8n\"><div class=\"dcr-fkf7vq\">Read more</div></div></div></div></div></figure><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">\u201cSo we want America and other world powers not to be partners in crime, but to call out General Museveni for the absence of human rights.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">\u201cI believe foreign aid, in many ways, is lost in patronage and corruption, only to have the burden of repayment on next generations. The aid we need is in sticking to values. If we have a good democracy and human rights, that will bring leaders who will stamp down on corruption.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">\u201cWe lose two-thirds of our annual revenue to corruption \u2013 10tn Ugandan shillings ($2.5bn) stolen every year. That figure comes from the inspector general of government, so it could be more. He could be giving us a low figure. Whichever way, it is huge,\u201d he said.</p><p class=\"dcr-16w5gq9\">\u201cOur debt burden is heavy, it will take us 97 years to pay back and of course we have new predators. But I believe it is fixable. We have human resources, we have a young, energised population. We are endowed with natural wealth and resources. If corruption is stamped out, we can make every sector work that could rise us from poverty and indebtedness.\u201d</p><figure class=\"dcr-173mewl\" data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\" id=\"41c7ec59-cfc3-44e1-bb68-10de930beab1\"><div class=\"dcr-1t8m8f2\" id=\"img-4\"><img alt=\"Bobi Wine and Barbie Kyagulanyi pose, smiling, in front of a lifesize gold Oscars\u2019 statue\" class=\"dcr-evn1e9\" height=\"296.66666666666663\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e2b03e919c8bf77711dc2ea32e1da02052f8ce8/0_0_7056_4704/master/7056.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\"/></div>Wine and his wife, Barbie Kyagulanyi, at the 96th Academy Awards in Hollywood, California, 10 March 2024.
