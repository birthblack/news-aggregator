        <div><p>US president issues scathing view of Chinese counterpart’s motivations amid escalating trade war with Beijing </p>
<p>Xi Jinping’s tour of south-east Asia this week is probably intended to “screw” the United States, Donald Trump has suggested, as Xi embarks on a five-day tour of some of the nations hardest hit by Trump’s tariffs.</p>
<p>China’s president visited Hanoi on Monday, where he met the leader of Vietman’s Communist party, Tô Lâm, called for stronger trade ties and signed dozens of cooperation agreements, including on enhancing supply chains, before heading to Malaysia.</p>
<p>Reacting to the Vietnam meeting, Trump said the discussions were focused on how to harm the US, but he didn’t hold it against the two countries.</p>
<p>“I don’t blame China; I don’t blame Vietnam,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “That’s a lovely meeting. Meeting like, trying to figure out: ‘How do we screw the United States of America?’”</p>
<p>Vietnam, a major industrial and assembly hub, is among countries in south-east Asia that are reeling from some of the most punitive of Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs, hit with a rate of 46%. The US is Vietnam’s main export market, for which it is a crucial source of everything from footwear and apparel to electronics.</p>
<p>In the first three months of this year, its exports to Washington amounted to $31.4bn, while Hanoi imported goods worth about $30bn from Beijing.</p>
<p>Xi’s visit to Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia this week comes as Beijing faces tariffs of 145%, and as other countries seek to negotiate reductions in their tariffs during a 90-day reprieve.</p>
<p>Xi’s trip to Hanoi offered an opportunity to consolidate relations with a neighbour that has received billions of dollars of Chinese investments in recent years, as China-based manufacturers moved south to avoid tariffs imposed by the first Trump administration.</p>
<p>In Malaysia on Tuesday, the Chinese leader said he was looking forward to “further deepening the traditional friendship” between the two countries.</p>
<p>“China will work with Malaysia … to combat the undercurrents of geopolitical and camp-based confrontation, as well as the countercurrents of unilateralism and protectionism,” Xi wrote in an article for Malaysia’s The Star newspaper.</p>
<p>Xi had planned to travel to the region before Trump’s tariff announcement, but the visit was fortuitously timed, with the Chinese leader positing China as a stable trading partner, in contrast to the chaotic policy backflips coming out of Washington.</p>
<p>In an article in Nhân Dân, the newspaper of Vietnam’s Communist party, Xi wrote that there were “no winners in trade wars and tariff wars” and that protectionism “leads nowhere”.</p>
<p>In a meeting with Vietnam’s prime minister, Pham Minh Chính, Xi said the two countries should oppose unilateral bullying.</p>
<p>Vietnam and many other south-east Asian countries are trying to maintain a delicate balancing act between the US and China amid fears the region could be used as a potential dumping zone for Chinese exports barred from the US.</p>
<p>Phan Xuan Dung, a research officer in the Vietnam studies programme at ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said: “If past patterns hold, it would be reasonable to expect that Vietnam might seek to balance this significant Chinese engagement with comparable diplomatic outreach to the United States or other partners in the coming months.”</p>
<p>Escalating tensions between the US and China have fuelled concerns about a decoupling of the world’s two largest economies, a fear the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, sought to dispel on Monday.</p>
<p>“There’s a big deal to be done at some point,” Bessent said when asked by Bloomberg TV. There did not “have to be” decoupling, he said, “but there could be.”</p>
<p>One of China’s lead officials overseeing Hong Kong hit out at the US on Tuesday over its trade war. Xia Baolong said in a televised speech that the dispute was “extremely shameless” and aimed to “take away Hong Kong’s life”. Hong Kong is subject to the same tariffs imposed on mainland China but has not proposed any of its own in retaliation.</p>
<p>Xia said China was not “afraid of trouble”. “Let those peasants in the United States wail in front of the 5,000 years of Chinese civilisation,” he said, possibly in reference to JD Vance’s recent criticism.</p>
<p>China-US tensions appear to have shifted some trade war battles to other fronts. Xi has sought further US-excluded cooperation with the EU, and in Latin America the US is pushing governments to reduce their financial ties with China.</p>
<p>Bessent said he had met the Argentinian president, Javier Milei, on Monday, telling Bloomberg the Trump administration was focused on helping Latin American countries avert what he called “rapacious” agreements made with China to give up mining rights in return for aid.</p>
<p>Beijing’s embassy in Argentina accused Bessent of “maliciously slandering and smearing” China and told the US to refrain from “obstructing and deliberately sabotaging” developing countries.</p>
<p>The White House had appeared to dial down the pressure recently, listing tariff exemptions for smartphones, laptops, semiconductors and other electronic products for which China is a major source.</p>
<p>But Trump and some of his top aides said on Sunday the exemptions had been misconstrued and would only be temporary. “Nobody is getting ‘off the hook’ … especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.</p>
