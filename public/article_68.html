        <div><p>County to cut budget by almost $90m as it tackles nearly $2bn in fire-related costs and cuts to federal funding</p>
<p>Los Angeles county is experiencing unprecedented financial challenges amid growing costs from the historic wildfires that ravaged the region earlier this year and a $4bn sex abuse case settlement, the county CEO said this week.</p>
<p>The region faces roughly $2bn in expenses related to January’s fires, which killed 30 people and destroyed nearly 17,000 structures. Earlier this month the county announced it had a $4bn agreement to settle thousands of claims of sexual abuse in juvenile facilities dating back 1959 – the largest such settlement in US history.</p>
<p>The potential loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding and slower property tax revenue growth have added to the county’s mounting challenges.</p>
<p>The county is expected to cut its budget by nearly $90m dollars under a spending plan proposed by the LA county CEO, Fesia Davenport.</p>
<p>“We are in uncharted territory with these simultaneous pressures on our budget,” Davenport said. “Any of these alone would be daunting, but taken together, these challenges – the wildfires, the AB 218 settlement and the threat of deep cuts in federal funding – are cause for great concern.”</p>
<p>The settlement will impact the budget for decades to come, Davenport said, with the county anticipating payments of hundreds of millions of dollars through 2030 and millions more through 2051.</p>
<p>Federal reimbursements for some wildfire costs are expected to take years, Davenport said.</p>
<p>The county is cutting 3% from department budgets and plans to eliminate more than 300 currently vacant positions. With proposed supply cuts, delayed equipment purchases and a reduction in the scope of certain programs, the county expects to save $88.9m, according to a county statement.</p>
<p>Layoffs are not anticipated at this time, Davenport’s office reported, adding that the recommended budget “reflects a high degree of caution, restraint and uncertainty in the face of the cascading budgetary pressures”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the city of Los Angeles continues to reel from the impact of the January wildfires. The city is facing a nearly $1bn budget gap that officials have said “makes layoffs nearly inevitable”.</p>
<p>“We are not looking at dozens or even hundreds of layoffs, but thousands,” the city administrative officer Matt Szabo told the city council last month.</p>
